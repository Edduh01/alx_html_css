        <h2>The Origin of the name MEDO_THE_BOY</h2>
        <P> It was on March 2023 when a friend of mine, Regina gave me the name medo_the_boy. 
            The name the_medo_boy was attained way back when I was in my high school Form 2. I had two names.
            The first one was The Drupiest Boy and the second was The Medo Boy.
        </P>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1> THE_DRUPIEST_BOY</h1>
        <P>The Drupiest Boy did not sound like a good name but I also liked it. 
            I decided to go public with the_medo_boy now medo_the_boy.
            (THE MEDO BOY &nbsp; &nbsp; MEDO THE BOY &nbsp; &nbsp;THE DRUPIEST BOY)

        <!-- This is my first html structure that I will be using to practice and keep notes inside here
        I have used a simple html structure that contains the necessary framework. What have understood is using
    the declaration and the tags which forms an html element. I have also noted when I should use some elements
The html is the closing and opening tag that everything comes in between. The head follows and the tittle tag comes in between
Then the body encloses everything that is going to appear-->
<ol>
    
</ol>
