        <!-- This is my first html structure that I will be using to practice and keep notes inside here
        I have used a simple html structure that contains the necessary framework. What have understood is using
    the declaration and the tags which forms an html element. I have also noted when I should use some elements
The html is the closing and opening tag that everything comes in between. The head follows and the tittle tag comes in between
Then the body encloses everything that is going to appear-->
<ol>
    
</ol>
