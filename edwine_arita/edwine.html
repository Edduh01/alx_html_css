        <h1> EDWINE ONCHAGWA ARITA</h1>
        <P> The name EDWINE ONCHAGWA ARITA was given to me by my parents</P>
        <h2>The Origin of the name EDWINE ONCHAGWA ARITA</h2>
        <P> It was when I was born. It is that simple        </P>
        <br>
        <h2> I was then nick named MEDO_THE_BOY</h2>
        <P> MEDO_THE_BOY originated from the business that I do online.
            I do some of them including:
            <ol>
                <li> Forex Tradig </li>
                <li>Article Writing</li>
                <li> Programming</li>
            </ol>
            So the name MEDO_THE_BOY came from my scholling system and decide
            to use the same name when we were doing business online
         </P>

        <!-- This is my first html structure that I will be using to practice and keep notes inside here
        I have used a simple html structure that contains the necessary framework. What have understood is using
    the declaration and the tags which forms an html element. I have also noted when I should use some elements
The html is the closing and opening tag that everything comes in between. The head follows and the tittle tag comes in between
Then the body encloses everything that is going to appear-->
<ol>
    
</ol>
